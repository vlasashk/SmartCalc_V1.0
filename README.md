## Introduction

Implementation of extended version of the usual calculator, in the C language. In addition, implemented the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.).
Support's the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.

In addition, implemented separate credit module to calculate Annuity/Differentiated loans.
